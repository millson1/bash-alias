## Additional Customization Tips

Here are some extra tips for customizing and using the bash alias script:

- To add your own aliases, edit the `setup-aliases.sh` file and append new `alias name='command'` lines.
- Choose descriptive alias names so you remember what each command does.
- After editing your aliases, run `source ~/.bashrc` (or restart your terminal) to load the changes.

These tips help you tailor the script to your workflow.
